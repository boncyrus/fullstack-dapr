# Overview 
This repo showcases on how to integrate Dapr into your services. It demonstrate how multiple microservices work together which makes an application. The contents of this repo is mainly for educational purposes and can serve as guide / reference if you want to Daperize your .NET applications. 

# Application
Majority of the code in this repo are backend services, additionally, I also created a Nextjs frontend to make it more than just calling the APIs and seeing them as json. You can try out the sample booking application which contains the following features:

- List flights
- Create a booking
- List user bookings

# Run the app
To run and debug the app you need to have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed. Set the **docker-compose** as startup project and hit F5!
